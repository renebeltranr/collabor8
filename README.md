# Collabor8: A platform for musicians to record and collaborate online

Collabor8 is a Web App that allows musicians from around the world to record and share tracks, creating a platform for collaboration and creating new music. With Collabor8, users can record their own tracks and add them to existing tracks to create covers or original collaborations.

## Tech Stack

The project uses: <br>
Express with Typescript <br>
MongoDB with Mongoose <br>
React with Typescript <br>

On top of that it uses Cloudinary to store media, so if you want to run it you'll have to register and place the keys on the .env files

## Getting Started

To get started with Collabor8, fork this repo and run 
<br>
<br>
```npm install``` 
<br>
<br>
both in the /server and the /client folders.

Then, create a .env file for the Client folder, that holds your keys to connect to Cloudinary to save your collab tracks and track pictures, following this format:
<br>
<br>
```REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_URL = https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/XXXXXXXXX/upload```<br>
```REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_PRESET = XXXXXXXX```
<br>
<br>

After that, go to the /src folder and run ```tsc``` to run the Typescript compiler. Once it's finished, just head to the /build folder and run the index file either by typing ```node index.js``` or running ```nodemon``` to dynamicaly restart the server when there's changes.
